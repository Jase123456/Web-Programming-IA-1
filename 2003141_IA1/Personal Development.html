        <h4>Pillar 4</h4>
        <p>called <br/> "Achieving Your Goals". 
            To track your progress "Plan, Do, Check, Adjust" is a smart way to do so. 
            As a result of attaining them, setting objectives has the 
            added benefit of making you a better person.
        </p>
        <h4>Pillar 5</h4>
        <p> Don't put it off; the end of your life will arrive sooner than you think.
            Remember that every day you spend is one fewer day you have to spend,
            so make the most of each one. "Every day brings a plethora of chances,
            but there is only one great opportunity."</p>
        <h4>Pillar 6</h4>
        <p>Every relationship you have, whether good, neutral, or bad,
            is an association. Choose your friends carefully because you will become like them.
            Surround yourself with winners, successful individuals who demonstrate
            and exemplify principles and talents you want to learn and improve.</p>
        <h4>Pillar 6</h4>
        <p>After completing your formal education, you will spend the majority of your life.
            Wealth, health, and spirituality all start with education.
            Consider your personal experiences to see what went well and what didn't.
            Read literature, look at successful individuals, and think about yourself. 
            You will make a fortune through self-education.</p>
